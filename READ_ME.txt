Main file is 'ReformatFasta.py'. Run this. 

FastaDump.txt is an example of a file one might download from the NCBI. It can be opened as a text file, but a lot of programs
will refuse to use it unless it is labelled '.fa'.

NewFile.txt is an empty text file to write to for your convenience.

To test whether the newly written file works in a real program, I suggest going to http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/
Itis a standard, open source multiple sequence alignment program I use quite often. Either upload the new file or copy paste its
contents into the input box. If it does not appear to be doing anything after you submit try reloading the page. It's weird like that 
sometimes. 

You can also allign FastaDump.txt. You will notice that all of the names on the left are the incomprehensible accession numbers. 

Best,
Nathan
