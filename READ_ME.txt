Open source alignment or phylogeny programs such as muscle and phylogeny.fr display accession numbers rather than organism/gene/protein
names. This makes analyzed data difficult to interpret. My program reformats the info lines (denoted by > characters) so that the 
accession numbers and organism name are switched. The programs will then display the organism name, saving the researcher the effort of manually changing every accession number in the text file before uploading to the program.
